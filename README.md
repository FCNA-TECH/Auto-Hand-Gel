An Arduino program that dispenses hand gel when an object (your hand) is detected close to the bottle, list of items needed for this project are: An Arduino board, Ultrasonic distance sensor, Servo (the plastic ones may be too weak so an MG servo would be used in this case) and finally a bottle of hand-gel.
